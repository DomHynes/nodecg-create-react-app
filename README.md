# NodeCG Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a work-in-progress for a NodeCG bundle that starts with the all-to-familiar Create React App. Currently, it generates two output folders and allows you to run a Graphics and a Dashboard component from the same CRA build.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm watch`

Runs the app in the dev / watch mode.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.
